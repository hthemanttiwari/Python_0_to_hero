# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. 
# The first digit in the input will specify the column (the position on the horizontal axis).
# The second digit in the input will specify the row number (the position on the vertical axis). 
# So an input of 23 should place an X at the position shown below:

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']

# Code Starts Here!

row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]

map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")

position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")

row = int(position[1])
column = int(position[0])

map[row - 1][column - 1] = "X"

print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
