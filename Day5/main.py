# My Day 5 learnings Are:

# for loop.
# Syntax is,
# for item in list_of_items:
    # Do Something


fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pears"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  print(fruit + " Pie")
# Mind the indentation in case for for loop
print(fruits)

# Here output will be,
# Apple
# Apple Pie
# Peach
# Peach Pie
# Pears
# Pears Pie
# ['Apple', 'Peach', 'Pears']


# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
# e.g. 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
# 1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. 
# You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Please note - In range function, last number is not counted.
# Therefore, the output will be from 1 to 9 and not 1 to 10.


# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
# The highest score in the class is: x
# 
# Example Input
# 78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
# In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# 
# Example Output
# The highest score in the class is: 91

# In range we can skip few places.

# Steping (skipping some values)
for number in range (1, 10, 3):

# Here the output will be
# 1, 4, and 7 as we are skipping the number by 3.


# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:
# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100
# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
